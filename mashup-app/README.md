# MASHUP FILMS APP

Here you will find the MashUp Trading dApp UI. 
Nice visually and interesting money generator/royalties for the MashUp Community Platform, the mashup film creator, and customers/fans/supporters.

## SETUP
Once in the directory `mashup-app`, please run the following command in your terminal:

`yarn install`

Place the `json`files: MashUpToken.json and MashUpTraderApp.json that you got from the compilation and deployment in the `mashup-app-contracts` within the `build/contracts` folders.

Place the Contract Address and Transaction Hash from `MashUpToken` and `MashUpTraderApp` within MashUpToken.js and MashUpTraderApp.js and the abi information (you got it in `mashup-app-contracts`).

## DEPLOY
Run in your terminal the following command:

`npm start`

You can start to interact with the MashUp Films dApp locally.

If you want to enhance the experience and publish live, you can build it running:

`yarn build`
